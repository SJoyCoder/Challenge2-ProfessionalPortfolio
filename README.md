## Who is this page for?
This page is created for potential employers who, down the road, would like to see examples of my work.

## Plans for the page
I have created it with ease of modification in mind. I currently do not have any projects, so I used some cute art I had bought as placeholder pictures and a link to my github in the meantime. I can also easily change the colors of the page to be more professional, for now I wanted something pretty to look at while I worked.
